Last summer I participated in a full-day guided tour along the second world war (WWII) invasion beaches in Normandy, France. Specific subjects of the tour were Omaha Beach and places where events of &#8220;Easy Company&#8221; ([E Company of the 2nd Battalion, 506th IR][2], 101st Airborne Division, US Army) a.k.a. the [Band of Brothers][3] took place. These true events are described in a [book][4] by [Stephen Ambrose][5] from which the famous [TV-series][3] was made in 2001 (the book is also worthwhile!). The tour was organized by [Overlord Tour][6]. This tour, in a company with mainly American WWII-buffs, was very in-depth and worldwhile, in particular in combination with the landscape. The Dutch painter/writer [Armando][7] once coined the phrase &#8220;guilty landscape&#8221; (&#8220;schuldig landschap&#8221;).

Since I have an interest in WWII history, geography, geospatial, GPS and multimedia, I made a trace with my [Garmin eTrex LegendÂ® HCx][8], shot photo&#8217;s/video and uploaded all to [georambling.com][9], one of my pet projects. You can [view the trace with geotagged media][10] there as well. I&#8217;ve also created a video with iMovie from all materials including the GPS traces (see below).

Subsequently I got a message from Google that my video was banned in Germany ! First I thought because of some swastika&#8217;s appearing (carried btw by American soldiers as a trophy after conquering Marmion&#8217;s farm), but the reason was more modern: it has to do with a [long-standing dispute between Google and the German collecting society, GEMA][11]. This makes more sense and may also explain the ads popping up to buy the music (roll over Beethoven). So it is not a [&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention the war&#8221;][12] thing. BTW I am a pacifist.
