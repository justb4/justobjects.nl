This is a &#8220;sign-of-life-post&#8221; as my [last blog][4] was in 2013. After too many years, I created a new website for [justobjects.nl][2] which also integrates my barren blog. These days, making a website is a breeze thanks to [WordPress][5] (WP) and [responsive design][6] themes. WP provides an ideal dynamic platform (just update regularly and minimize plugins). I hope to regularly publish here about some of the Open Geospatial projects I am working on plus other events in the [OSGeo][7] arena and my personal thoughts on &#8220;Open Geospatial&#8221;.

Huh, &#8220;Open Geospatial&#8221;? Ok, one of the main issues I am struggling with is how to call my/our working domain. I often try to explain this as a combination of two domains:

  1. what is known as [&#8220;GIS&#8221;][3], &#8220;Geospatial&#8221;, or better  [&#8220;Spatial IT&#8221;][8] (watch this Paul Ramsey Video!).
  2. the world of  [Free Software][9], [Open Source Software (OSS)][10] and [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)][11]

Both have definition issues. How to even name the combination of these two, so that your family, friends and even IT-folks immediately know [what you are doing][12] (another recommended Paul Ramsey video)? A challenge. I sometimes call it the [intersection][13] of the two, but set-theory gets too far for some. The abbreviation [FOSS4G][14] appeals, but gives confusion with the great conferences by that name.

And then I  would even like to include [Open Standards][15] and [Open Data][16] into the mix. So, for convenience, I have dubbed the domain here as Open Geospatial, maybe Open Spatial would be better, at least the term summarizes reference to the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)][17] and the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)][7].

Ok, probably I should not bother, but if someone comes up with a crisp definition, I am Open (sic!).
