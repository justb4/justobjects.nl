Investigated the [W3C SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Interchange Language)][1]. Goal was to see what SMIL is and how it can be used in the [KeyWorX][2] multi-user environment.  

(from <http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo>)  
The Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced "smile") enables simple authoring of interactive audiovisual presentations. SMIL is typically used for "rich media"/multimedia presentations which integrate streaming audio and video with images, text or any other media type. SMIL is an easy-to-learn HTML-like language, and many SMIL presentations are written using a simple text-editor.
