Much has happened since on what may be called the &#8220;Home Media Center&#8221;. For example Linux [Myth TV][2] on a barebones PC like the Asus Pundit. The stuff below is for reference.

**The Challenge**  
Around the house I have numerous devices that each serve multimedia functions:

[Tom&#8217;s Hardware &#8211; good intro to TV cards  
][3] [Tweakers.net][4] &#8211; Hauppauge WinTV Radio versus Miro PCTV Pro  
[Linuxgazette][5] &#8211; shows how to install a TV card + realproducer

 **Hauppauge**  
So far the [Hauppage WinTV PVR 350][6] seems to match  
this feature set only the reviews are differing. But most importantly the  
[SourceForge project that develops PVR Linux drivers][7] for its MPEG-2 capabilities seems to have been abandoned. UPDATE: [A new? sourceforge project][8] is going strongly. Capturing a video stream from the MPEG encoder seems to work.

 **Linux Media Labs**  
[Linux Media Labs][9] has produced a couple of linux video capture cards.The LML33 is a hardware Motion JPEG capture card, and the LMLM4 does hardware MPEG-4 compression. They are a bit expensive and I&#8217;m not sure either of those cards has a bulid-in tuner.  
 **ATI**  
Need more research on ATI cards like the [ALL-IN-WONDERÂ® RADEON 8500][10]  
It seems a bid odd to have an integrated video/TV card&#8230;
