Opened an experimental site for [GeoSailing][1] to cover the [24 Uurs Zeilrace][2], the largest Dutch annual sailing event. Some 800 ships are competing on the IJsselmeer, Markermeer and Waddenzee to cover as many miles as possible within a 24 hour period. This event is held on August 26 and 27, 2005. One of the competitors will be the Semper, sailed by Dennis,Peter, Rolf and Jelmer. If it all works out the Semper can be followed live, complete with media made and submitted on the spot.

Based on the concepts and software for [GeoSkating][3] and [GeoSailing][1] I am working on a more generic framework for [GeoTracing][4]. The key idea is to provide a customizable application for live tracing, annotated mapping, GPS-based digital storytelling and location-based media for any outdoors activity.
