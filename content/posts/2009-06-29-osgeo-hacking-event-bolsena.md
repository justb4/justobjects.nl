For a week developers from various Free/Open Source Geo-projects (mostly  [OSGeo][3] projects) get together in a monastry near Bolsena for code sprints, cross-project discussions, presentations, enjoying italian food and more fun. I have been working on the  [GeoNetwork][4] project some time, so it was good to meet and work with the GN team. Meeting project leads and developers and following presentations from other projects like [GeoServer][5], [Deegree][6] and [MapBender][7] was really worthwhile. To get an impression you can watch the media mix I made from various photo&#8217;s/videos made by me and other participants.
