[Sense of Brainport][2] again a [GeoTracing project][3] was launched on September 21, 2006. During one week [participants][4] from [Brainport][5] were &#8220;geotracing&#8221; the region of Eindhoven/&#8221;Zuid Oost Brabant&#8221; with a mobile phone and a GPS.

During the event they could be traced [in real-time on the map][6]. While tracing the tracers are posting photos of their impressions. These photo&#8217;s are geotagged at the location taken. All their routes are stored in an archive for [viewing and playback][7].
