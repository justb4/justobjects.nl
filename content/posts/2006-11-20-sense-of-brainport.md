<a href="http://www.senseofbrainport.nl" target="_new">Sense of Brainport</a> again a <a href="http://www.geotracing.com" target="_new">GeoTracing project</a> was launched on september 21, 2006. During one week <a href="http://www.senseofthecity.nl/sobp/deelnemers.jsp" target="_new">participants</a> from <a href="http://www.brainport.nl" target="_new">Brainport</a> were &#8220;geotracing&#8221; the region of Eindhoven/&#8221;Zuid Oost Brabant&#8221; with a mobile phone and a GPS.

During the event they could be traced <a href="http://www.senseofthecity.nl/sobp/map.jsp?cmd=live" target="_new">in real-time on the map</a>. While tracing the tracers are posting photos of their impressions. These photo&#8217;s are geotagged at the location taken. All their routes are stored in an archive for <a href="http://www.senseofthecity.nl/sobp/map.jsp" target="_new">viewing and playback.</a>
