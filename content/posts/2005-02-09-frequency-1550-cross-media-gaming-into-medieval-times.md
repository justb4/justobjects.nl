[Frequency 1550][1] is a multi-user city game using mobile phones and GPS-technology. The game provides a real-time, location-based experience, transporting players into medieval Amsterdam of 1550 via today&#8217;s most advanced personal medium: a UMTS mobile phone. It is the one of the most exciting projects I ever worked on!F ind more info in <a href="http://www.computable.nl/artikel/achtergrond/onderwijs/1415901/1277214/umtspilot-in-middeleeuws-amsterdam.html">an article in the Computable magazine</a> (Dutch).

[There is a project presentation in streaming video on connect.waag.org][2]. There are also [slides of presentations][3]. I gave at the [Dutch Java User Group (NLJUG)][4] and at the [Society for Old and New Media (KillerClub)][5].

The project even hit the national news ! Click [on anchor-man Gijs][7] to watch the Flash video.

The game evolves around players being personages in an adventure where they help the &#8220;schout&#8221; (medieval police) who will contact them by video when entering zones or reaching (GPS) locations. Players will try to solve assignments given by the &#8220;schout&#8221; on the street or through one of their<br /> team members on the home base, HQ, (behind a Flash-based interface). Assignments are solved by making media (photo&#8217;s, videos) at the spot<br /> and submitting these. The HQ may consult internet for additional media and textual answers. Thus together, teams provide multi-media<br /> content, resulting in a media-collage at the end. Additional game elements include, GPS-based boobytrapping, confrontations and cloaking.

My task in this project was development of the server-side gaming engine, media management and location tracking. Yes, the server was done in Java using the [KeyWorx][8] platform. Client software was done using the Java 2 Mobile Edition (J2ME) for the phones and Macromedia Flash for the HQ.

I am grateful to have been part of the team at [Waag Society][9] who has initiated and developed this mobile learning game together with IVKO, part of the Montessori comprehensive school in Amsterdam. The project was supported by [KPN][10] who supplied mobile phones and access to their UMTS network. A pilot has just been conducted in 2005 from 7 to 9 February.
