Overview of my professional life in 2021. Highlights of living and working in the Open Source Geospatial and OSGeo([.nl][1]|.[org][2])-world in 2021. 
Organized by "Theme".

Like 2020, 2021 was again a "special year" in pandemic terms. How to cope? 
Like Paul Ramsey writes: [I feel like sharing some of my favourite things](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2022/01/things.html).
Will do in a later post: [Bird-watching](https://waarneming.nl/users/146535/observations/), [Wolf-tracking workshop](https://www.weylintracking.nl/workshop-wolvensporen/), 'catching' big game on new wildcam, developed outdoor GPS-game (Veluwe Big Five), some progress on guitar-playing, 
discovering The Netherlands outback, becoming 
a [Billy Strings](https://www.billystrings.com/) fan. These are a few of my favourite things, so more later....


TL;DR Main three 2021 highlights: 

* Organizing and attending an in-real-life [FOSS4G-NL](https://foss4g.nl/) with OSGeo.nl
* Attending, presenting, moderating, online [FOSS4G Buenos Aires](https://2021.foss4g.org/) 
* Deep-diving into [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitop). 

Below follow 2021-highlights organized by theme and/or project.

## 1. Fun Home Automation Projects

Some of my 2022 fun resolutions resolved in 2021: 

* Installed an [HP1000SE PRO Wi-Fi Internet Wireless Weather Station](https://www.froggit.de/product_info.php?language=en&info=p436_hp1000se-pro-wi-fi-internet-wireless-weather-station.html). Using [weewx on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/justb4/weatherstation). Publishing a.o. to [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/IGELDERL153).
* Wildcam

{{< a-img data-src="/uploads/2022/wildcam.jpg" data-caption="Some mammals on the Wildcam" >}}

More on these later.

## 2. New Website

For years my website/blog [justobjects.nl](https://justobjects.nl) ran on Wordpress at the famous, and first (est. 1993), 
Dutch internet/hosting provider [XS4ALL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS4ALL). XS4ALL was sold to KPN (1998), remained an independent brand,
but was finally dismantled in 2021. 

So in early 2021 a new hosting provider was needed. 
This was also a good moment to migrate my website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
With the great effort by [@peter-govind](https://github.com/peter-govind) (via [freelance.com](https://freelance.com)), we converted the complete site (about 20 years of blogs) 
to [Hugo+Github](https://github.com/justb4/justobjects.nl), using GitHub Workflows to "deploy-on-commit". My first piece of GitOps, more to follow, in 2021.
Though there are still some fixes to do, very happy with the result. Maintaining is now a breeze.

## 3. GitOps

Gradually [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) became my main theme in 2021. 
Discovered that there was actually a name (GitOps) for CI/CD practices I (you) have been doing over the past years.
For example, in 2019 I worked on the [pygeoapi demo server](https://github.com/geopython/demo.pygeoapi.io). GitOps can always be taken further
until reaching the phase: "look ma, no hands!". No more "Box Hugging", i.e. no more SSH-ing, manual actions on VMs etc.

So what is GitOps? Many definitions are available. Often [tied to Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/gitops-and-kubernetes) (K8s), but GitOps is broader than K8s.
The most concise I found at [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops):

_"GitOps is a set of practices to manage infrastructure and application configurations using Git, an open source version control system. GitOps works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications."_

I often quote here: **"The Truth is in Git!"**. Especially now in times of fake-news, I love speaking those words in presentations.
The quest of humanity is over: We Found The Truth, It Is In Git :-).
Pun aside, it takes effort to have 100% of your deployment sources and configs in Git. In particular all required credentials 
(passwords, keys etc). Think of storing credentials in a public GitHub repo, how? Did some amazing discoveries in that area like
(combining) GitHub Secrets and [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html).


I was very lucky that my main three contracts in 2021 involved GitOps. One project sort of followed the other.

### Geonovum

It all began in June at [Geonovum](https://www.geonovum.nl/themas/testbed-ogc-apis) who started an OGC API Testbed as part of
their ongoing [Dutch API Strategy](https://www.geonovum.nl/themas/kennisplatform-apis) theme. 

Together with [GeoCat](https://geocat.net) [Paul van Genuchten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvangenuchten/), developed a full-stack deployment for several [OGC API Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) implementations.
The picture below depicts the stack elements:

{{< a-img data-href="https://apitestdocs.geonovum.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2022/gitops/services-stack.png" data-caption="GitOps Deployment - Operational Stack" >}}

The challenge was to provide a testbed environment where third parties could further extend and experiment.
Eventually we developed a deployment fully based on [GitOps within GitHub](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed) as a GitHub Template repo.
You can read details in the [documentation](https://apitestdocs.geonovum.nl/).
The picture below depicts the GitOps workflow:

{{< a-img data-href="https://apitestdocs.geonovum.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2022/gitops/schema.png" data-caption="GitOps Workflow" >}}

These results were presented at several occasions in 2021. See the Presentations below.

### Geocat

For GeoCat (again with Paul van Genuchten), exploring and setting out how to further migrate to full GitOps 
for the [GeoCat Live](https://www.geocat.net/live/) environment.

### European Commission - Joint Research Center

Was already working on a contract with [EC-JRC](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en) 
for pan-EU data sharing as a member of the "EU JRC ELISE Pool of Experts".
An honour to be (still) working with all these great minds from the international geospatial world!

My focus within the team was/is on data services deployment. My pitch and first deliverable, was called
*"The Power of Orchestrated Containerisation for Data Services"*.

The full outcome of the project will be published (publicly) as a JRC Technical Report (JRC127730?) titled:
*"Emerging approaches for data-driven innovation in Europe"*. For this report, wrote the 
chapter *"Deployment of an OGC API Features web service using GitOps"*
 
Apart from reporting in text, also provided a full-stack OGC API Features service based on [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io).
Using the [Geonovum OGC API GitHub Template](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed) 
on a fresh Ubuntu VM provided by JRC, this was a great Proof-of-Concept: took just 2 hours to
get the complete stack, including stuff like SSL-certificates, [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) proxy (love Traefik!), OS-hardening etc, [up and running](https://jrc.map5.nl/).
For now the GitHub repo is at [github.com/justb4/ogc-api-jrc/](https://github.com/justb4/ogc-api-jrc/).

{{< a-img data-href="https://apitestdocs.geonovum.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2022/gitops/pygeoapi-jrc.png" data-caption="pygeoapi for EC JRC" >}}

## 4. OSGeo.nl

### FOSS4G-NL 2021 - IRL

Yes, it happened! Inbetween COVID-Waves a LOC lead by the great [Erik Meerburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikmeerburg/) achieved to organize 
an in-real-life (IRL) [4th OSGeo.nl FOSS4G-NL conference](https://foss4g.nl). 
Abiding with COVID-regulations at the time. At ITC Enschede on October 19-20 2021. Using 2G access. 
Zero COVID-cases after.

One day of Workshops followed by a one-day conference with great international keynotes 
by [Amelie A Gagnon from UNESCO-IIEP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelieagagnon/) and 
[Kurt Menke from Septima DK](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtmenke), plus three parallel sessions.
We are still preparing the website to publish all presentations.

{{< a-img data-href="https://foss4g.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2022/foss4gnl/group-photo.jpg" data-caption="Group Photo FOSS4G 2021" >}}

Looks unreal this group photo, but this was in 2021!
Thanks to all who made this event a success!

### The Big Geo Show

This was already my 2020 highlight. You can watch back all shows via **[tv.osgeo.nl][3]** or directly on 
the **[OSGeo.nl YouTube Channel][42]**. Hell, you can even **[binge-watch all episodes][4]**! 

{{< a-img data-href="https://youtu.be/nhlIqMyBIig" data-src="/uploads/2022/dggs/osm.jpg" data-caption="Episode 15 - OpenStreetMap Special with Ilya Zverev" >}}

In 2021 we did six shows, each a Special:

* Episode 14: [Newyear with QGIS-NL and OpenStreetMap-NL communities](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0014/). 
* Episode 15: [OpenStreetMap Special](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0015/). Special guest: Ilya Zverev a.k.a. [Zverik](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Zverik)!
* Episode 16: [GIS with your Keyboard](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0016/)
* Episode 17: [On Geospatial Databases](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0017/)
* Episode 18: [Cartography Special](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0018/)
* Episode 19: [Ten Years of OSGeo.nl - Story in Pictures](https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0019/)

{{< a-img data-href="https://tv.osgeo.nl/episode/episode-0016/" data-src="/uploads/2022/dggs/gis-keyboard.jpg" data-caption="Episode 16 - GIS with your Keyboard"  >}}

With a real instant-music-composer-performer, [Luci√´n Greefkes](https://www.muziektaal.nl/) 
in our team, we together made a [new DGGS leader video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrfrcpWR29s).

### OSGeo.nl - Ten Year Anniversary
                                     
OSGeo.nl was established on Dec 2, 2011. So 10 years, still going strong! 
On dec 2, 2021 we were in a new wave, so a small online event. Below the epic picture (by Arnulf Christl) 
taken at the GIN Congres Utrecht 2011 where we got together to start OSGeo.nl.

{{< a-img data-href="https://osgeo.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2022/osgeonl-founding.jpg" data-caption="OSGeo.nl Founding Mothers and Fathers - 2011" >}}

A special episode of the Big Geo Show presents: [Ten Years of OSGeo.nl - Story in Pictures](https://youtu.be/yMAxQEg0fSw).

## 5. Geospatial Cloud Services

Moved into providing Geospatial Cloud Services last few years, 
both as a source of income and to support/strengthen underlying open source 
projects with which they are developed. Warning: shameless ads below. All below was ongoing in 2021.

  * **[map5.nl][5]** is a subscription service for Dutch topographic, historical- and embellished hill-shade and arial maps I started to host in 2015. In 2021 work started for a map5.nl user portal.

{{< a-img data-href="https://www.map5.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2020/01/map5.nl_.png" >}}


  * **[GeoQoS.com][6]** is a hosted **[GeoHealthCheck][7]** (GHC) service on a subscription basis. GHC is an uptime and QoS monitor for (OGC) web services. Customers get their own GHC instance. **[GeoQoS.com][6]** saves the burden of self-hosting GHC. In 2021 started work on a GHC API, using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and a new GHC-UI.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geoqos.com/" data-src="/uploads/2020/01/geoqos.com_.png" >}}


  * **[geotoko.nl][8]**, in short GeoToko, is basically a webshop to download Dutch open geo-datasets. One may ask: Dutch geospatial data like Topography, Addresses and Buildings, is already open and publicly available, mainly via **[Kadaster-PDOK][51]**. So why bother reselling? Explanation follows.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/opentopo-keyreg.png" >}}


  Most Dutch Open geospatial datasets, available from governmental institutions like Kadaster, are provided in a neutral exchange-format. In practice: GML (Application Schema). Most users are not able to directly digest complex GML in their applications (or don't want to spend time on that). For over 10 years we run the Open Source project **[NLExtract][52]** to convert these datasets into formats like PostGIS and CSV that can be directly used in applications. NLExtract itself builds on **[Stetl][11]**, an Open Source geospatial ETL-library in Python. NLExtract/Stetl is used a lot, but still will require users to install/maintain an NLExtract/Stetl installation, download datasets, run the ETL, check results etc. That may also be a bridge too far, if e.g. all a customer needs is a one-time CSV of say, all 10 million addresses in The Netherlands. So GeoToko taps into this niche, providing ready-to-use, often enriched Dutch datasets. Pricing is reasonable, compared to other providers, plus organizations and individuals may get highly reduced pricing when they work on Open data applications like OpenStreetMap.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/bigpicture.png" >}}

  As for development: the **[GeoToko webshop][8]** was developed with Django, Flask/nginx (Download management), Stripe (backend payments) and **[CKAN][53]**. The latter to provide a product-catalogue, sample data and metadata in general, all via **[GeoCatalogus.nl][54]**.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/geofabriek-keten.png" data-caption="GeoFabriek - Production Chain">}}


Further development concerned automating the NLExtract/Stetl ETL-processes. 
For this a framework called GeoFabriek, "GeoFactory", was developed. This automates the entire chain from checking new dataset versions at Kadaster, through downloading, conversions, packing for download and updating the metadata (in GeoCatalogus.nl).


## 6. Open Source Contributions

Continuous work as a contributor. Apart from some GitLab Projects, you can find/follow me best on [GitHub][10].

![GitHub contributions](/uploads/2022/github-contribs-2021.png)

New in 2021:

* [FastAPI-Users starter Template repo](https://github.com/justb4/fastapi-users-starter)
* [NLExtract][16] - added ETL for BAG version 2, my first PRs for GDAL!

Ongoing in 2021:

* [Stetl][11] - Geospatial ETL in Python, maintaining since 2011.
* [GeoHealthCheck][12] - Service Status and QoS Checker for OGC Web Services.
* [pygeoapi][13] - a Python server implementation of the [OGC API suite of standards][57] - joined this great project in 2019. Also in PSC.
* [pygeoapi demo server][14] - provided the (auto-)deployment stack for the pygeoapi demo server ([code at GitHub][15]). Added [COVID-19 NL data provider][58].
* [NLExtract][16] - ETL for Dutch geospatial datasets.
* [Wegue][17] - geo-webclient framework based on [Vue.js][18] with OpenLayers started by [Christian Mayer][19]. Joined this great project in 2019. Unfortunately hardly contribs in 2021.
* [Heron MC][20] - Web Mapping Client based on [GeoExt][21] and OpenLayers. Yes, old tech but still in wide use. In time hope to migrate to [Wegue][17] (see above). Migrating Heron to Wegue, see first example below.
  

### More Contributions - Handy Docker Images

To support many of the Cloud services and Open Source projects, I develop and maintain [handy Docker Images][62], also available from [my DockerHub][24].
Ongoing in 2021. In the progress of moving all to Github Workflows build/push, replacing DockerHub Autobuild (still awaiting DockerHub Open Source waiver...):

* [docker-awstats][25] - AWStats in Docker, oldie, but very effective webstats. Deploy multiple instances in single Docker container. Highly configurable, e.g. also for [Traefik][26] access logs.
* [docker-jmeter][27] - [Apache JMeter][28] wrapped in Docker. Over 10 million pulls at end of 2021. And 180 stars, but still [zero donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=3QZW9SNGCWBM4)! C'mon people, not even using JMeter myself...
* [docker-mapfish-print][29] - for MapFish Print **version 3**. MapFish Print allows printing maps as PDFs.
* [docker-mapfish-print2][30] - for MapFish Print **version 2** - This version is still used in quite some contexts, at least for [Heron][20] and [KadViewer][31].
* [docker-rclone][32] - Docker image to perform a [rclone][63] sync based on a cron schedule, with [healthchecks.io][64] monitoring.
* [docker-pgbackup][33] - automated/scheduled PostgreSQL/PostGIS backups for all PostgreSQL-based Docker Containers in its Docker-network. I think it is nifty: just run and forget: your Postgres backups are taken care of. Inspired by: <https://github.com/kartoza/docker-pg-backup>.
* [docker-mapserver][65] - Slim Docker Image for MapServer with Lighttpd FastCGI.
* [docker-mapproxy][66] - MapProxy Docker Image adapted, slimmed, from the [YAGA Development-Team][67]. [Awaiting PR merge][68].
* [docker-mapproxy-mapserver][69] - Docker Image for MapProxy service with built-in MapServer binaries accessed directly (no MapServer service).
* [docker-cron][70] - Runs Unix cron, includes docker (compose) client for running remote Docker Images.


## 7. Conferences - Attended

* Feb 6-7 [FOSSDEM 2021](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/) - Virtual
* Sept 27- Oct 22 - [FOSS4G Buenos Aires][36] - Virtual
* Oct 19-20 - [FOSS4G-NL at ITC Enschede][72] - In Real Life

[FOSS4G Buenos Aires][36] needs special mention. As an online conference, apart from amazing content, I was very impressed with the 
technical and organizational setup. Even the social events were fun to join. Folks are tired of Zoom, Teams, etc but
the FOSS4G LOC had introduced tools like [Work Adventure](https://workadventu.re/) and [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) (also used by OSgeo.nl in Big Geo Show) to enable more "cozyness". 
Offcourse nothing can replace a real event, but this came close. The Gala Dinner was really fun!

Jody Garnett words it very well in his Tweet:

{{< a-img data-href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jodygarnett/status/1444022337968295938" data-src="/uploads/2022/foss4g/thankyou.png" data-caption="Thank You!" >}}

Never forget, always in our hearts: Malena Libman (1983-2021).
FOSS4G 2021 was also a conference dedicated to, and in memory of, Malena Libman. 
She was a pillar of the FOSS4G community and a leading organizer of this conference. 

{{< a-img data-href="https://mappery.org/malena-libman/" data-src="/uploads/2022/foss4g/malena.png" data-caption="Malena - Photo from mappery.org" >}}

Malena was the right and truthful winner of the Sol Katz Award 2021. 
As the [OSGeo.org website states](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/malena-libman-receives-the-2021-sol-katz-award/):
*"Malena Libman is the Sol Katz Award winner 2021. The prize was presented at the FOSS4G closing session and handed over to her friends & family who accepted the award on her behalf since we sadly lost Malena in April 2021 to COVID-19."*

Not as much fun as in 2019 Bukarest, but providing the Geopython Workshop at FOSS4G Buenos Aires with those great minds
is still a 2021-highlight.
