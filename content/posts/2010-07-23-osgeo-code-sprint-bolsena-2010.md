For one week developers from various Free and Open Source for Geospatial (often abbreviated as FOSS4G) projects get together in a [monastery near Bolsena][5] for code sprints, cross-project collaborations, presentations and geo-hacking in general. This all takes place in a relaxed atmosphere mostly outside. Thanks to the cook Enzo we enjoyed the Italian kitchen. This year I did some work on [GeoNetwork][6] and more in depth on [INSPIRE FOSS][7], a new FOSS project I initiated to support the development of [INSPIRE][8] using FOSS. In Bolsena I worked closely together with the [deegree][9] lead developers Markus Schneider and Andreas Schmitz from [lat/lon][10]. At the spot we were able to construct a [demo][11] that showcased the power of the upcoming [deegree version 3 WFS/WMS][9] in supporting [INSPIRE][8] Data Themes. Meeting project leads and developers and following presentations from other projects like [GeoServer][12], [deegree][9] and [MapBender][13] was really worthwhile. Like last year I have made a video impression you can see below or on [YouTube][14].
