[Sense of the City][2] the latest [GeoTracing project][3] was launched on april 21, 2006. During the last week of april 2006, ten civilians are &#8220;geotracing&#8221; the Dutch city of Eindhoven with

a mobile phone and a GPS. During the event they can be traced [in real-time on the map][4].

&nbsp;

While tracing the tracers are posting photos of their impressions. These photo&#8217;s are geotagged at the location taken. All their routes are stored in an archive for [viewing and playback.][5]
