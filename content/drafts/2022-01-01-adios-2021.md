Overview of my professional life in 2021. Highlights of living and working in the Open Source Geospatial and OSGeo([.nl][1]|.[org][2])-world in 2021. 
Organized by "Theme".

Like 2020, 2021 was again a "special year" in pandemic terms. 

TL;DR Highlights: Organizing a in-real-life FOSS4G-NL with OSGeo.nl, the online "big" FOSS4G Buenos Aires and deep-diving into GitOps. 
And finally starting using FastAPI. 

Below follow 2021-highlights organized by theme.

### Fun Home Automation Projects

* Weather Station 
* Wildcam

### New Website

### GitOps


### OSGeo.nl - The Big Geo Show

This was my 2020 highlight. You can watch back all shows via **[tv.osgeo.nl][3]** or directly on 
the **[OSGeo.nl YouTube Channel][42]**. Hell, you can even **[binge-watch all episodes][4]**! 


In 2021 we started with a Newyear Special with OSGeo-NL, QGIS-NL and OpenStreetMap-NL communities. 
Only the plenary first half-hour in StreamYard, then next a new platform where all can participate and mingle. 
Just watch and participate on sun, jan 24, 2021, 3 PM (GMT+1) via **[tv.osgeo.nl][3]**.

### OSGeo.nl - Ten Year Anniversary

### Geospatial Cloud Services

Moving into providing Geospatial Cloud Services last few years, both as a source of income and to support/strengthen underlying open source projects with which they are developed. Warning: shameless ads below.

  * **[map5.nl][5]** is a subscription service for Dutch topographic, historical- and embellished hill-shade and arial maps I started to host in 2015. In 2020 the entire map5.nl server-infrastructure was moved from custom Ubuntu-installs to a complete **[Ansible][50]**/Docker-based setup.

{{< a-img data-href="https://www.map5.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2020/01/map5.nl_.png" >}}


  * **[GeoQoS.com][6]** is a hosted **[GeoHealthCheck][7]** (GHC) service on a subscription basis. GHC is an uptime and QoS monitor for (OGC) web services. Customers get their own GHC instance. **[GeoQoS.com][6]** saves the burden of self-hosting GHC. Launch was in 2019, growing steady in 2020. Expect to work more on API and new UI for GeoHealthCheck (below) in 2021.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geoqos.com/" data-src="/uploads/2020/01/geoqos.com_.png" >}}


  * Feb 2020 - launched **[geotoko.nl][8]**. geotoko.nl, in short GeoToko, is basically a webshop to download Dutch open geo-datasets. Here one may ask: Dutch geospatial data like Topography, Addresses and Buildings, is already open and publicly available, mainly via **[Kadaster-PDOK][51]**. So why bother reselling? This needs some explanation.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/opentopo-keyreg.png" >}}


  Most Dutch Open geospatial datasets, as available from governmental institutions like Kadaster, are provided in a neutral exchange-format. In practice: GML (Application Schema). Most users are not able to directly digest complex GML in their applications (or don't want to spend time on that). For over 10 years we run the Open Source project **[NLExtract][52]** to convert these datasets into formats like PostGIS and CSV that can be directly used in applications. NLExtract itself builds on **[Stetl][11]**, an Open Source geospatial ETL-library in Python. NLExtract/Stetl is used a lot, but still will require users to install/maintain an NLExtract/Stetl installation, download datasets, run the ETL, check results etc. That may also be a bridge too far, if e.g. all a customer needs is a one-time CSV of say, all 10 million addresses in The Netherlands. So GeoToko taps into this niche, providing ready-to-use, often enriched Dutch datasets. Pricing is reasonable, compared to other providers, plus organizations and individuals may get highly reduced pricing when they work on Open data applications like OpenStreetMap.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/bigpicture.png" >}}

  As for development: the **[GeoToko webshop][8]** was developed with Django, Flask/nginx (Download management), Stripe (backend payments) and **[CKAN][53]**. The latter to provide a product-catalogue, sample data and metadata in general, all via **[GeoCatalogus.nl][54]**.

{{< a-img data-href="https://geotoko.nl" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/geofabriek-keten.png" data-caption="GeoFabriek - Production Chain">}}


  Further development concerned automating the NLExtract/Stetl ETL-processes. For this a framework called GeoFabriek, "GeoFactory", was developed. This automates the entire chain from checking new dataset versions at Kadaster, through downloading, conversions, packing for download and updating the metadata (in GeoCatalogus.nl).

### Contract Work

As my focus is more and more on providing "Geospatial Cloud Services" (see above), did not take not too much contract work in 2021, 
though I am always open for offerings! All three contracts dealt with implementing GitOps.


* For [Geonovum](https://geonovum.nl). Developed a Wegue **[interactive map for the German National Park Luneburger Heide][9]**. 
  {{< a-img data-href="https://map.naturpark-lueneburger-heide.de/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/screenshot-1.png" >}}

* For GeoCat
* For EC JRC


### Open Source Contributions

Continuous work as a contributor. Apart from some GitLab Projects, you can find/follow me best on [GitHub][10].

![GitHub contributions](/uploads/2022/github-contribs-2021.png)

  * [Stetl][11] - Geospatial ETL in Python, maintaining since 2011.
  * [GeoHealthCheck][12] - Service Status and QoS Checker for OGC Web Services.
  * [pygeoapi][13] - a Python server implementation of the [OGC API suite of standards][57] - joined this great project in 2019. Also in PSC.
  * [pygeoapi demo server][14] - provided the (auto-)deployment stack for the pygeoapi demo server ([code at GitHub][15]). Added [COVID-19 NL data provider][58].
  * [NLExtract][16] - ETL for Dutch geospatial datasets.
  * [Wegue][17] - geo-webclient framework based on [Vue.js][18] with OpenLayers started by [Christian Mayer][19]. Joined this great project in 2019.
  * [Heron MC][20] - Web Mapping Client based on [GeoExt][21] and OpenLayers. Yes, old tech but still in wide use. In time hope to migrate to [Wegue][17] (see above). Migrating Heron to Wegue, see first example below.

{{< a-img data-href="https://wegue.heron-mc.org/" data-src="/uploads/2021/01/screenshot-heron-wegue-1.jpg" >}}


### More Contributions - Handy Docker Images

To support many of the Cloud services and Open Source projects, I develop and maintain [handy Docker Images][62], also available from [my DockerHub][24].

  * [docker-awstats][25] - AWStats in Docker, oldie, but very effective webstats. Deploy multiple instances in single Docker container. Highly configurable, e.g. also for [Traefik][26] access logs.
  * [docker-jmeter][27] - [Apache JMeter][28] wrapped in Docker. Over 1 million pulls!
  * [docker-mapfish-print][29] - for MapFish Print **version 3**. MapFish Print allows printing maps as PDFs.
  * [docker-mapfish-print2][30] - for MapFish Print **version 2** - This version is still used in quite some contexts, at least for [Heron][20] and [KadViewer][31].
  * [docker-rclone][32] - Docker image to perform a [rclone][63] sync based on a cron schedule, with [healthchecks.io][64] monitoring.
  * [docker-pgbackup][33] - automated/scheduled PostgreSQL/PostGIS backups for all PostgreSQL-based Docker Containers in its Docker-network. I think it is nifty: just run and forget: your Postgres backups are taken care of. Inspired by: <https://github.com/kartoza/docker-pg-backup>.
  * [docker-mapserver][65] - Slim Docker Image for MapServer with Lighttpd FastCGI.
  * [docker-mapproxy][66] - MapProxy Docker Image adapted, slimmed, from the [YAGA Development-Team][67]. [Awaiting PR merge][68].
  * [docker-mapproxy-mapserver][69] - Docker Image for MapProxy service with built-in MapServer binaries accessed directly (no MapServer service).
  * [docker-cron][70] - Runs Unix cron, includes docker (compose) client for running remote Docker Images.

### OSGeo.nl

As chair of the board, still involved in the OSGeo Dutch Local Chapter, [OSGeo.nl][34] since its establishment in 2011.

  * Jan 12 - organizer - joint [OSGeo.nl and OpenStreetMap NL new-years party][71] at Cafe Dudok in Hilversum. Our last IRL event in 2020&#8230;.

No FOSS4G-NL, plans are for okt 2021, but hey, 13 episodes of [De Grote Geo Show][3] (see above)!

### Conferences - Attended

  * Sept 27- Oct 22 - [FOSS4G Buenos Aires][36] - Virtual
