Just Objects offers monitoring and Quality of Service (QoS) checking for your (OGC-based) geospatial web services as a SAAS on [geoqos.com][1] using the [Open Source GeoHealthCheck Framework][2].

![ ][5]

Keeping geospatial web services (WMS, WFS etc) up and running is challenging. You may already have general HTTP-monitoring.

But how would you know when a single layer is failing, or degrading in performance?

This requires [Geospatial Service-aware Monitoring][3].

The Open Source tool [GeoHealthCheck (GHC)][4] does exactly that: 
detailed healthchecks on many (QoS) aspects of (OGC) geospatial web services. But you may want to be relieved of deploying and maintaining a GHC service instance yourself. Hence, geoqos.com offers Hosted GeoHealthCheck, in the Cloud, on a subscription basis.
