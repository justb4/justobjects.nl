Via [geotoko.nl][1] ready-to-use Dutch Open Geospatial datasets are offered.
These include Topography (BRT, BGT), Adresses and Buildings (BAG) and Cadastral Parcels (BRK).

Why? Most of the Open Geospatial Datasets provided by the Dutch government (mostly via [Dutch Kadaster/PDOK][6])
are in an interchange format called "GML". Many parties find this format hard to process.
Via the Open Source project [NLExtract](5) we have been providing ETL-tools to convert 
these datasets to "chewable" formats like PostGIS, GeoPackage and CSV.
Still this may be a bridge too far for some. Hence we provide the datasets
already converted to these formats. At reasonable prices!

There is a (CKAN-based)  [GeoCatalogue][2] and we provide a [Helpdesk][3] and 
a regular [Newsletter][4]. All in Dutch btw.

Notifications, mainly new datasets, for [geotoko.nl](https://geotoko.nl) are still on Twitter/X:
